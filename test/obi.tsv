OBI:0001139	OBI:0000048				liquid chromatography instrument	A chromatography device that dissolves a mixture in liquid mobile phase to separate the analyte to be measured from other molecules in the mixture and allows it to be isolated										
OBI:0000605	OBI:0000048				chart recorder	The chart recorder is a device that transduces signal-intensities into a graphical peak output: As the separated components of the gas sample emerge into the detector, the change in voltage in the detecting bridge circuit causes a representative peak to be drawn on a chart recorder. The position of the peak along the time axis of the chart measures the component's retention time, which identifies the component. This is directly related to carrier gas flow rate, temperature and column packing and dimensions. The area under each peak is proportional to the concentration of the component of the sample. The area of the peaks inscribed on the chart recorder can be determined by multiplying the height of the peak in mm, by the width of the peak in mm at 1/2 the peak height. The calibration curves for use with the chart recorder are therefore peak area plotted against concentration.										
OBI:0000601	OBI:0000048				chromatography consumable	A chromatography consumable is a consumable that is used in a chromatography experiment.										
OBI:0000619	OBI:0000048				chromatography splitter	An adjustable restriction that is placed in the waste outlet to allow the necessary pressure to develop at the column inlet to force a flow (q ml/min) through the column. If the flow of mobile phase is Q ml/min then the waste flow will be (Q-q) ml/min. by adjusting the waste flow, the proportion of the sample entering the capillary column can be varied over a wide range of values and the necessary minimum permissible volume for the particular column in use can be selected for analysis. Unfortunately, the fraction taken in this way may not be representative of the original sample. This is due to the individual solutes in the mixture having different diffusivities and, thus, they distribute themselves across the sampling tube in an irregular manner. In general, the components with higher diffusivities (e.g., those solutes of lower molecular weight) will diffuse away from the bulk sample more quickly than those having lower diffusivities.

OBI:0000478	OBI:0000048				column connector	A device that connects two or more columns together in a functional way with leak-tight connection, low dead volume, low thermal mass and high inertness.										
OBI:0000602	OBI:0000048				column frit	A part of the column content that separates column packing compartments. In radial columns the packing is supported between two cylindrical frits and the gap between represents the bed height or column length. The outer frit is the column inlet and consequently the sample initially has a large area of stationary phase with which to interact. Frits are porous metal products to prevent unwanted particles from entering the chromatography system. These particles may come from the sample, the solvent or debris generated by the chromatography system itself. Such particles entering the system may lead to clogging of capillaries, interference with the chromatography by changing chromatographic parameters or disturbance of the detector function. Characteristics of a frit, besides the diameter and the thickness, is the porosity (pore distribution, density).

OBI:0000528	OBI:0000048				liquid chromatography valve	A sample valve that must be able to sustain pressures up to 10,000 p.s.i., although it is most likely to operate on a continuous basis, at pressures of 3,000 p.s.i. or less. The higher the operating pressure the tighter the valve seating surfaces must be forced together to eliminate any leak. It follows that any abrasive material, however fine, that passes into the valve can cause the valve seating to become scored each time it is rotated which will ultimately lead to leaks. This will cause the sample size to vary between samples and eventually affect the accuracy of the analysis. It follows that any solid material must be carefully removed from any sample before filling the valve. The sample volume of an internal loop valve is situated in the connecting slot of the valve rotor and can be used only for relatively small sample volumes. Internal sample loop valves provide samples with volumes ranging from 0.1 ml to about 0.5 ml. Valve operation is shown in figure 6. The left-hand side diagram shows the load position. The sample occupies the rotor slot and has been filled by passing the sample from an appropriate syringe through the rotor slot to waste. While loading the sample, the mobile phase supply is passed through the valve directly to the column. To place the sample onto the column, the valve is then rotated and the valve slot containing the sample is now placed between the solvent supply and the column. As a result, the sample is passed into the column by the flow of solvent.

OBI:0000536	OBI:0000485				fraction collector	A fraction detector is a device that allows regular or specified samples to be taken from a column eluate and stored in a retrievable form. The storage vessels are usually small sample tubes or vials that are oriented in a rotating disk or in a moving belt, there movement usually being controlled by a microprocessor. On receiving a signal from the microprocessor, the next vial is placed under the column outlet and the eluate collected until receiving another signal from the computer. Once the properties of the chromatogram that describes the separation has been ascertained, then the collection program can be defined. The fractions can be collected on a basis of time either at regular intervals or a specific times to collect specific peaks. Alternatively the fractions can be collected by monitoring the detector output and when a peak starts to elute the fraction collector is activated and the peak collected in a specific vial. When the peak returns to base line the column eluate is then directed to waste until the next peak starts eluting. Fraction collectors are in common use with most liquid chromatographs. They are used to collect samples for further purification, subsequent examination by spectroscopic techniques or for biological or organoleptic testing.

OBI:0000525	OBI:0000504				splitless GC injector	Injected sample enters column immediately (while split valve to split vent is closed). Here a sample is introduced into a heated small chamber via a syringe through a septum - the heat facilitates volatilization of the sample and sample matrix. The carrier gas then either sweeps the entirety (splitless mode) or a portion (split mode) of the sample into the column. In split mode, a part of the sample/carrier gas mixture in the injection chamber is exhausted through the split vent.

OBI:0000507	OBI:0000542				gas generator	An instrument that generates gases for use with the gas chromatograph. Previously gas was obtained from gas tanks or gas cylinders. However, over the past decade the use of gas generators have become more popular as it avoids having gases at high pressure in the laboratory which is perceived by some as potentially dangerous. In addition, the use of a hydrogen generator avoids the use of a cylinder of hydrogen at high pressure which is also perceived by some as a serious fire hazard despite the fact that they have been used in laboratories, quite safely for nearly a century.

OBI:0000590	OBI:0000561				Bruker 1mm MicroProbe	Over the past few years there has been a significantly growing demand for miniaturization in all areas ofmodern research and development. Evoked by many exciting applications, there is a need for analytical methods which require less amounts of sample. Bruker BioSpin meets this challenge with a revolutionary NMR probe design: The 1mm MicroProbe. It operates with disposable 1mm capillary sample tubes and the sample volume of 5 microliters enables the use of lowest amounts of sample to run all high resolution NMR experiments with outstanding sensitivity and up to 16 times faster measurements. Due to the TXI-type probe design, the z-gradient coil and the automatic matching and tuning accessory, the 1mm MicroProbe can be used for a wide variety of NMR experiments. The key advantages of this probe include:\n   up to 4 times higher mass sensitivity than 5mm conventional probes (with respect to the same sample amount)\n   excellent solvent suppression properties\n   virtually no salt effect\n   discrete samples in tubes that can be sealed and stored\n   automation accessory for sample preparation and handling available.										
OBI:0000531	OBI:0000561				Bruker CryoProbe	The Bruker BioSpin CryoProbe is a high-performance cryogenically cooled probe developed for high-resolution applications. It has improved signal/noise (S/N) ratios obtained by reducing the operating temperature of the coil and the pre-amplifier. As a result, the efficiency of the coil is improved and the noise of the coil and the pre-amplifier are reduced.The dramatic increase in the S/N ratio by a factor of 3-4, as compared to conventional probes, leads to a possible reduction in experiment time of up to 16 or a reduction in required sample concentration by a factor of up to 4. The CryoProbes possess key characteristics for NMR analysis:\n   Significant S/N gains (with moderately salty samples also)\n   Short pulse widths\n   Short ring down times\n   Linear behavior in power response\n   Gradient capability\n   CryoProbes are available as Triple Resonance, Dual, Selective X Detection, MicroImaging, and Quad Nucleus Probes configurations at 400 MHz and higher\n   All high resolution probes have a lock circuit\n   All high resolution probes have Z-gradient.

OBI:0000495	OBI:0000589				vacuum degasser	A degassing system used for degassing solvents in liquid chromatography. Dissolved gasses, usually nitrogen and oxygen from the air, tend to be evolved in the mobile phase as the pressure is reduced when the mobile phase leaves the liquid chromatography column and enters the detector. Gasses in the mobile phase in the detector can produce completely unacceptable noise and, thus, must be removed. The dissolved gasses were originally removed under vacuum but, unfortunately, are soon replaced if the solvent is left in contact with air at atmospheric pressure. For this reason degassing is now usually carried out by bubbling helium through the mobile phase reservoirs. Secondly, vacuum is used in the thermionic detector. This consists of a device, very similar in design to the thermionic valve which is attached to a vacuum and a small quantity of the eluent from a gas chromatography column allowed to bleed through it. Helium is used as the carrier gas. The presence of solute vapor causes the thermionic current to fall. This type of detector tends to become contaminated rather readily.										
OBI:0000538	OBI:0000592				in-line filter	A solvent filter that sits between the pump and the injection valve that prevents dust particles, general debris and, to some extent, bacteria from entering the chromatography system. Contaminants can interfere with the low-pressure gradient former or the pump and particles entering valves may interfere with the proper function. The result could cause an increased baseline noise, non-repeatable gradient forming, unreliable flow rate or other interferences. Solvent in-line filters are low-pressure filters and will allow a high flow rate due to a large surface area and large porosity.										
OBI:0000543	OBI:0000592				syringe filter	A small membrane filter of defined pore size, that filters samples from a syringe.										
OBI:0000580	OBI:0000596				AVANCE II spectrometer	A spectrometer suitable for metabolomics and in vivo NMR studies but structural analysis of small molecules and low molecular weight proteins can also be performed.

In addition to the 5 mm triple resonance probe, the AMX is equipped with a 10mm broadband observe probe.										
OBI:0000553	OBI:0000596				Bruker Capillary LC-NMR platform	Capillary LC-NMR is a hyphenated technique coupling capillary liquid chromatography and NMR, which increases sensitivity dramatically through the use of miniaturization of the chromatographic techniques and NMR detection volume. LC-NMR hyphenated systems separate a mixture into its pure components and couple the output to NMR for automatic sample analysis. The ever increasing need to measure lower sample amounts and lower level impurities demands the highest NMR sensitivity. Traditional LC-NMR systems with relatively large peak volumes are not optimized for such low levels of detection. Bruker BioSpin, together with Waters and Protasis has developed a Capillary LC-NMR system. The latest capillary LC attributes and highest capillary flow probe sensitivity combine with state of the art NMR systems technology. Greater mass sensitivity and faster spectral analysis with smaller sample volumes is possible. This system is ideal for analysis of metabolites and impurities associated with the drug development process.										
OBI:0000503	OBI:0000596				Bruker LC-NMR platform	The LC-NMR/MS setup was first introduced by Bruker BioSpin in 1999. An LC-NMR system including a Bruker Peak Sampling Unit (BPSU-36) was coupled with a Bruker Daltonics esquire series ion trap mass spectrometer via a Bruker NMR-MS interface (BNMI). Since October 2004 the Bruker Daltonics microTOF-LC time-of-flight mass spectrometer can also be integrated in an LC-NMR setup.

OBI:0000568	OBI:0000601				piston-seal	The seal made by a piston in a diaphragm pump. The unique property of the reciprocating diaphragm pump is that the actuating piston does not come into direct contact with the mobile phase and thus, the demands on the piston-cylinder seal are not so great. The diaphragm has a relatively high surface area and thus, the movement of the diaphragm is relatively small and consequently the pump can be operated at a fairly high frequency. High frequency pumping results in a very significant reduction in pulse amplitude and, in addition, high frequency pulses are more readily damped by the column system. Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that diaphragm pumps are not pulseless.

OBI:0000642	OBI:0000637				atomic emission detector	Instead of measuring simple gas phase (carbon containing) ions created in a flame as with the flame ionization detector, or the change in background current because of electronegative element capture of thermal electrons as with the electron capture detector, the AED has a much wider applicability because it is based on the detection of atomic emissions. The strength of the AED lies in the detector's ability to simultaneously determine the atomic emissions of many of the elements in analytes that elute from a GC capillary column (called eluants or solutes in some books). As eluants come off the capillary column they are fed into a microwave powered plasma (or discharge) cavity where the compounds are destroyed and their atoms are excited by the energy of the plasma. The light that is emitted by the excited particles is separated into individual lines via a photodiode array. The associated computer then sorts out the individual emission lines and can produce chromatograms made up of peaks from eluants that contain only a specific element.										AED
OBI:0000509	OBI:0000637				electron capture detector	The electron capture detector is a GC detector that uses a radioactive Beta emitter (electrons) to ionize some of the carrier gas and produce a current between a biased pair of electrodes. When organic molecules that contain electronegative functional groups, such as halogens, phosphorous, and nitro groups pass by the detector, they capture some of the electrons and reduce the current measured between the electrodes.										ECD
OBI:0000521	OBI:0000637				flame ionization detector	A flame ionization detector is a GC detector that consist of a hydrogen/air flame and a collector plate which are normally heated independently of the chromatographic oven. Heating is necessary in order to prevent condensation of water generated by the flame and also to prevent any hold-up of solutes as they pass from the column to the flame. There is an electrode above the flame to collect the ions formed at a hydrogen/air flame. The number of ions hitting the collector is measured and a signal is generated. Flame ionization detectors are most widely used and generally applicable for gas chromatography and hence is used for routine and general purpose analysis. It is easy to use but destructive of the sample.										FID
OBI:0000588	OBI:0000637				flame photometric detector	The determination of sulfur or phosphorus containing compounds is the job of the flame photometric detector (FPD). This device uses the chemiluminescent reactions of these compounds in a hydrogen/air flame as a source of analytical information that is relatively specific for substances containing these two kinds of atoms. The emitting species for sulfur compounds is excited S2. The lambda max for emission of excited S2 is approximately 394 nm. The emitter for phosphorus compounds in the flame is excited HPO (lambda max = doublet 510-526 nm). In order to selectively detect one or the other family of compounds as it elutes from the GC column, an interference filter is used between the flame and the photomultiplier tube (PMT) to isolate the appropriate emission band. The drawback here being that the filter must be exchanged between chromatographic runs if the other family of compounds is to be detected.										FPD
OBI:0000617	OBI:0000637				fluorine-induced chemiluminescence detector	A gas chromatographic detection system based on the low pressure, gas phase chemiluminescence of the reaction mixture of molecular fluorine with organo-sulfur, -selenium, and -tellurium compounds separated from (gas phase) headspace samples. This detector was originally developed in the research group of John Birks at the University of Colorado, USA and was manufactured and sold by Sievers Instruments (Boulder Colorado, USA). This system can be divided up into three parts: the chromatograph, transfer line, and reaction cell; PMT and photon counting electronics; and the molecular fluorine generator.										
OBI:0000569	OBI:0000637				mass selective detector	A mass selective detector is a GC detector that uses mass spectrometry. It is based upon the ionization of solute molecules in the ion source and the separation of the ions generated on the basis of their mass/charge ratio by an analyzer unit. This may be a magnetic sector analyzer, a quadruple mass filter, or an ion trap. Ions are detected by a dynode electron multiplier.										mass spectrometry detector
OBI:0000489	OBI:0000637				nitrogen phosphorous detector	The nitrogen phosphorus detector (NPD) (sometimes called the thermionic detector) is a very sensitive, specific detector the design of which, is based on the FID. Physically the sensor appears to be very similar to the FID but, in fact, operates on an entirely different principle. The nitrogen phosphorous detector (sometimes called the thermionic detector) is a very sensitive but specific detector that responds almost exclusively to nitrogen and phosphorous compounds. It is based on the flame ionization detector but differs in that it contains a rubidium or cesium silicate (glass) bead situated in a heater coil, a little distance from the hydrogen flame. If the detector is to respond to both nitrogen and phosphorous then the hydrogen flow should be minimal so that the gas does not ignite at the jet. If the detector is to respond to phosphorous only, a large flow of hydrogen is used which is burnt at the jet. The heated bead emits electrons by thermionic emission. These electrons are collected under a potential of a few volts by an appropriately placed anode, and provides a background current. When a solute containing nitrogen or phosphorous is eluted from the column, the partially combusted nitrogen and phosphorous materials are adsorbed on the surface of the bead. The adsorbed material reduces the work function of the surface and, as consequence, the emission of electrons is increased which raises the current collected at the electrode. The sensitivity of the detector to phosphorous is about 10-12 gram per ml and for nitrogen about 10-11 gram per ml at a signal to nose ratio of 2. The alkali bead as a finite life and needs regular replacement.										
OBI:0000598	OBI:0000637				ozone-induced chemiluminescence detector	Although there are many direct ozone chemiluminescent reactions with various gaseous molecules, the incorporation of a conversion step to convert various non-chemiluminescent analytes to a species capable of reacting with ozone to produce chemiluminescence broadens the horizon of this technique tremendously. The conversion of nearly all nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds to their respective chemiluminescent species for universal nitrogen and sulfur detection has made nitrogen/sulfur chemiluminescence detection the most widely used analytical methods based upon ozone-induced chemiluminescence. In addition to non-chromatographic applications, nitrogen/sulfur chemiluminescence detection has been adapted to various chromatographic techniques from gas chromatography to liquid and supercritical fluid chromatography as specialized element-specific detectors. The characteristics of these detectors are evaluated and compared to other element-selective detection techniques. The unique features of the chemiluminescence detectors have made them powerful tools in many diverse fields of analytical chemistry.										
OBI:0000506	OBI:0000637				photoionization detector	The selective determination of aromatic hydrocarbons or organo-heteroatom species is the job of the photoionization detector (PID). This device uses ultraviolet light as a means of ionizing an analyte exiting from a GC column. The ions produced by this process are collected by electrodes. The current generated is therefore a measure of the analyte concentration. f the amount of ionization is reproducible for a given compound, pressure, and light source then the current collected at the PID's reaction cell electrodes is reproducibly proportional to the amount of that compound entering the cell. The reason why the compounds that are routinely analyzed are either aromatic hydrocarbons or heteroatom containing compounds (like organosulfur or organophosphorus species) is because these species have ionization potentials (IP) that are within reach of commercially available UV lamps. The available lamp energies range from 8.3 to 11.7 ev, that is, lambda max ranging from 150 nm to 106 nm. Although most PIDs have only one lamp, lamps in the PID are exchanged depending on the compound selectivity required in the analysis.										PID
OBI:0000466	OBI:0000637				thermal conductivity detector	The most commonly used detector in preparative GC is the thermal conductivity detector (hot wire detector). Even this detector, however, is often too sensitive and has too high a flow impedance. Under such circumstances, the procedure mentioned above must be employed.

OBI:0000565	OBI:0000832				electrical conductivity detector	The electrical conductivity detector measures the conductivity of the mobile phase.

Thus, the electrical conductivity detector a bulk property detector. and senses all ions whether they are from a solute or from the mobile phase. In order to prevent polarization of the sensing electrodes, AC voltages must be used and so it is the impedance not the resistance of the electrode system that is actually measured. From a physical chemistry stand point the conductivity of a solution is more important than its resistance.
